This is a Exploratory Data Analysis project which I conducted over movie budget and revenue.

<h1>Outcomes of this Analysis are-</h1> 

movie budget and revenue analysis:
In this data science project, I tried to analyse a movie dataset to see what patterns we can uncover in the movie budget and its revenue and what we can learn about the movies in general.

The project had the following objectives:

**Descriptive Statistics**
1.	What is the average production budget of the films in the data set?
2.	What is the average worldwide gross revenue of films?
3.	What were the minimums for worldwide and domestic revenue?
4.	Are the bottom 25% of films actually profitable or do they lose money?
5.	What are the highest production budget and highest worldwide gross revenue of any film?
6.	How much revenue did the lowest and highest budget films make?
**Investigating the Zero Revenue Films**

1. How many films grossed `$0` domestically i.e., in the USA
2.	What were the highest budget films that grossed nothing?
3.	How many films grossed $0 worldwide?
4.	What are the highest budget films that had no revenue internationally?

**Unreleased Films**
1.	Identify which films were not released yet as of the time of data collection (May 1st, 2018).
2.	How many films are included in the dataset that have not yet had a chance to be screened in the box office?

**Films that Lost Money**
1.	What is the percentage of films where the production costs exceeded the worldwide gross revenue?
Separate the "old" (before 1969) and "New" (1970s onwards) Films
2.	How many films were released prior to 1970?
3.	What was the most expensive film made prior to 1970?

**Regression Plots**
1.	Do our data points for the new films align better or worse with the linear regression than for our older films?

2.	Roughly how much would a film with a budget of $150 million make according to the regression line?
